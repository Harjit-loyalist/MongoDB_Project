# Production Line Tracking:
 
(Develop a database to track products through the production line.)

## Project Description:

In this project we are going to make A production line tracking system that tracks the flow of goods through several stages of manufacturing by integrating hardware sensors, data collection tools, and software elements. A frontend interface allows users to engage with the system, a backend application processes and manages data, and a database stores production data. Sensors, data gathering tools, a database management system, a backend program, and a frontend interface are important parts. Tables for items, production phases, production line tracking, quality assurance, and personnel are usually included in the database schema. Essential components of creating and managing a dependable production line tracking system are integration, security, testing, and maintenance.
